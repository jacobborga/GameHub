# GameHub
This project is my first ever in Ruby, and hopefully the start to many more projects in this language. There have been multiple barriers when it came to learning to combine Python and React such as OO structuring problems and how to setup the flow of data. Ruby pretty much solves all of this by allowing **Rails** to build interactive web applications with ruby. **This application doesn't contain any Rails**, but it does describe my Ruby learning experience.

Description:
    A cli application that contains a bunch of mini-games.

NOTE: To run the application you **must** have Ruby installed.

Once that is done, open up your favorite CLI and type "ruby bin/gamehub" to start the app.
